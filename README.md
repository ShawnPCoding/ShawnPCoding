# 👋 Hi there, I'm Shawn Pham

🎓 *Data Science Student | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Real-World Problem Solver*

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate data science student deeply engaged in solving complex problems using machine learning and artificial intelligence. My work revolves around uncovering insights from data, building reproducible models, and creating impactful applications that connect theory with the real world.

## 🧠 What Drives Me

I believe that **data is the bridge between curiosity and innovation**. With each project, I aim to:
- Uncover **actionable insights** from raw data
- Build **interpretable and robust ML models**
- Tackle **real-world challenges** with applied AI
- Constantly refine my understanding through **experimentation and intuition**

My projects blend statistical rigor with software engineering best practices to deliver solutions that are not only performant but also explainable and ethical.

## 🚀 Key Projects & Highlights

### 🔍 Heart Disease Risk Classifier (2025)
A classification model trained on a cleaned dataset with over 70% duplicate entries — tackled through advanced preprocessing and sampling strategies. Focused on generalizability, low variance, and reproducibility using:
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- SVM and KNN with hyperparameter tuning
- A full evaluation suite (confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, learning curves)

### 🧵 Parallel Quicksort with `pthread` in C++
High-performance sorting of large vectors using low-level multithreading. Benchmarked against sequential baselines with `clock()` for time analysis. Explores shared memory concurrency and thread synchronization.

### 🖼️ Distributed Image Processing Web App
Designed a Python-based web app using Docker containers and MPI for distributed computation. Users can:
- Log in securely
- Upload and process images
- Store results in a persistent database
The backend optimizes processing using GPU acceleration with OpenCL.

### 📈 Hacker News & Lemmy Mental Health NLP
Collected and filtered thousands of community discussions to identify patterns of anxiety, isolation, and loss of motivation. Tools and techniques:
- Sentiment analysis with `VADER` and `TextBlob`
- Content-length filtering and engagement metrics (comments, upvotes)
- Emphasis on ethical NLP and user well-being detection

## 🧪 Methodology I Believe In

I follow a research-driven, iterative pipeline:

Problem → Data Audit → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Evaluation → Optimization → Deployment


I care about:
- Reproducibility through well-documented pipelines
- Fairness and bias detection in models
- Modular, scalable, and testable code
- Communicating results clearly with visualizations and storytelling

---

## 🧭 What's Next?

I'm currently exploring:
- Foundation models (LLMs, CLIP, Segment Anything)
- Reinforcement learning and bandits
- AutoML and experiment tracking tools like MLflow
- Applications of ML in **mental health**, **education**, and **social impact**
